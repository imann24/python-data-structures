# Python Data Structures
Practice implementing common data structures in Python

## Running
1. Data structures were written and tested in Python 3
1. General convention is to provide a `test.sh` executable in folder to validate data structure

## Conventions
1. Recognize the advantages of using a package management solution (like `pipenv`), but opted against for this project
1. Aim to make dependency usage minimal/only for debugging
1. Classes should be drag-and-drop between projects
    1. Prefer to keep them environment agnostic
    1. Any dependencies, e.g. `ppbtree` are stored within the workspace
